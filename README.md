# odin-recipes
First html site project for the "Foundations" Section of the Odin Project.

In this project, I will build a basic recipe website in html.

I will use techniques for creating lists, bold/italic text, insersting images and links.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few Ethiopian recipes.
